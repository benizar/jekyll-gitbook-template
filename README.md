# How to Use
## Adding Content

- Markdown files: Add your content in the _posts directory for blog-style posts or directly into specific folders for chapters or sections.
- Bibliography: Manage your references by editing the references.bib file located in the root directory. You can then cite them in your markdown files using the jekyll-scholar syntax.

## Building the Site

When you are ready to deploy your site, you can build it using:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```
The generated static files will be placed in the _site directory, ready to be hosted on GitHub Pages or any other static site hosting platform.
Customizing the Theme

You can customize the theme by modifying the _config.yml file and the styles in the assets/css directory.

- Config options: Change site-wide settings such as title, description, and navigation in _config.yml.
- Layout and styles: Tweak the layout in _layouts and _includes, and update styles in assets/css/style.css.
